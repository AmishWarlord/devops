-- Place raw SQL commands in this file to run them as administrator.
-- You can also create more .sql or .sh files in this folder to automatically run them in alphabetical order at startup.
-- This is a good way to initialize your database.
-- Note, if you want to use environment variables in a sql command, you must use a .sh file. SQL cannot read your environment variables.

-- example SQL commands below. They will not run unless you remove the '/*' and '*/' symbols: 

/*
CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
USE exampledb;
SELECT * FROM sys.objects
*/
